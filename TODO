- use short calls for static callees (dubious: functions from one file can end
  up in different sections)
- optimize virtual register loads (keep track of what currently resides in
  real registers; very hairy) in fact, it is not possible at all. We can
  never tell if a jump target will be inserted somewhere; need to write a
  separate optimizer pass/program.
- replace all the shifts for type conversion (very ineffienct on 65816) with
  ands (done for char, some shifts remain)
- optimize constant float/int conversion
- untangle the mess that is libm.asm
- turn on the extra-complicated long long-safe compare opis only for long long compares
- optimize .data (or .bss?) section accesses by using absolute instead of long
  addressing (tricky; I see no way to find out the section of a symbol)
- optimize bitfield shifting (can do shift & and instead of shift & shift)
- optimize test branches (right now, a lot of cascaded branches are
  generated instead of patching them to all go to the same place)
- fix long stack accesses (adjust_stack() doesn't work well because it
  doesn't know the locals size at runtime; macros seem to be entirely
  broken)
- check if the bool casting workaround in 816-gen.c is still necessary and
  remove it if not
- translate SNESC library and kernel to C
- make sure section sorting is done in a stable way (use file_id) (don't
  remember why I put this in, it has been too long ago; testing suggests
  this is already the case; could depend on the qsort() implementation,
  though)

- fix bug in TCC that assumes registers to spill always contain ints (too
  short for long function pointers) DONE!
- move .bss and .data to banks $7e/$7f and leave LoRAM for stack and
  registers DONE!

- test/fix bitfields (TCC death shift in cast from int) DONE!
- remove a lot of redundant stz.b's in 2-byte type ops DONE!
- fix/test long long DONE! WITH MULL! (no divmod yet, needs external lib; the
  mull is actually a 1:1 adaption of the 16x16 6502 code; I guess this would
  work for division, too.)
- test/fix literal pointer dereferencing DONE!
- find out how TCC generates its FP constants and fix it to work with Woz code DONE!
- properly define registers (in ramsection, not as .defines) DONE!
- implement int/float conversions (currently only ftoi works) DONE!
- implement/test float parameter passing (receiving works) DONE!

- implement/test float comparisons DONE!
- teach the damn assembler to autoallocate banks, not just mess them up
  later :( DONE! (use "superfree" sections, one for each function)
- fix globals scalars initialized wrong DONE! (unportable code in TCC overwrote
  because it didn't take target type sizes into account)
- write systematic typecast test DONE!
- test/fix int/long long conversion (int -> long long certainly works...) DONE!
- implement float/(unsigned) long long conversion DONE! (except signed long long ->
  float, which is implicitly cast to int currently)
- fix char sign extension DONE! (was broken in several places in different
  ways) DONE AGAIN! (was particularly broken for long long source type)
- handle long long -> float conversion properly (should be possible to reuse
  tcc__ulltof)	DONE!
- implement & test all opis DONE! (I think, maybe I have missed something)
- fix inaccuracy in unsigned long long -> float conversion DONE!
- optimize the ugly way TCC loads the pointer to the upper half of long
  longs DONE! (worked around yet another TCC long long bug to get it to
  work)
- optimize shifts (throw out a few useless compares and convoluted
  branching) DONE!
- implement floating point (big one... still looking for 65816 FP lib) DONE!
  (for +, -, *, /, comparisons and casts; no function library yet)
- remove lots of obsolete debug output DONE!
- fix thinko in 32-bit loads DONE! (amazing that looked as if it was working
  in most cases)
- use tcc__llfix for float to unsigned int conversions (workaround to
  prevent overflow) DONE!
- try some funky arrays (floats, chars, long longs etc.) DONE!
- startup code breaks if main not in bank 0 DONE!
- test/fix pointer/int and pointer/long long conversion DONE! (as far as
  possible; int/pointer works as expected after a small fix to the compare
  code (handle symbols), long long/pointer is rejected by TCC)
- test/fix control structures (switch, if, for; while is tested extensively
  elsewhere) DONE! (gjmp/gsym code needed fix for chained jumps)
- optimize output routine DONE! (fourfold speed increase)
- test/fix overflow handling when converting float -> (unsigned) long long DONE!
- initialized global floats probably don't work (code missing in init_putv()) DONE!
- optimize indirect loads without displacement (don't load Y) DONE!
- implement/test long long division (use 6502 16x16 division routine from WDC) DONE!
- test float arithmetic DONE! (+, -, * work perfectly; / has one single
  problem dividing 0x7fff by -0x8000, resulting in -1 instead of 0; this is
  not unlikely to be the result of inaccuracy (an error of 2^-15 would be
  enough to cause it))
- when loading long longs to compare reg, load upper word, too DONE! (seems
  this is wrong in all other code generators; may need fixing for constant
  case, but I have been unable to trigger it so far -> guarded with error())
- fold short to int and test DONE! (tested by typedeffing __int as short)
- implement VT_JMPI (triggered e.g. by comparing long longs for equality)
  DONE! (trial and error, may not be 100%)
- systematic test of operations with constants (use unary framework) DONE! (42)
- combine small functions into one text section (WLA DX barfs if fed more
  than 255 sections) DONE!
- merge FP accus and f0/f1 registers to avoid constant shuffling about of FP
  numbers DONE!
- test/fix ellipsis (needs va_* macros, should not be that tricky) DONE!
- implement (32-bit)/test (all) shifts DONE!
- move runtime lib stuff to libtcc.asm DONE!
- fix (32-bit)/test (all) modulos DONE!
- fix strange/ashrdi-1.c (half a pointer is loaded and then derefd; look for
  ld2 [sp,-12],r0. the long long code (near the shortcut) sets the type for
  the second word load to VT_INT; changing this to VT_PTR fixes this issue,
  but creates others) DONE! (worked around by forcing 4 byte loads while in
  long long code; disabled shortcut as it breaks this test, too)
- implement merging of multiple .data sections (where? wla? tccelf? external
  script?) wlalink is the most likely candidate DONE!
- test section merging DONE! (hw3a.c)
- introduce file-local symbol concept to wlalink DONE!
- change (section-)local prefix in wlalink to something less annoying DONE!
- fix bool casting (same as char) DONE!
- loads half a pointer again in 20030313-1.c after calling __tccs_bar DONE!
  (TCC reloaded everything saved to the stack as VT_INT)
- make VT_ENUM and VT_BOOL unsigned to fix problems with sign extension in
  bitfields DONE!
- make sure bitfield values are not recast after being shifted to the right
  place (breaks _Bool bitfields) DONE!
- make sure bitfield values are cast before being shifted to the right place
  (also breaks _Bool bitfields) DONE!
- fix binary output code so it can handle multiple symbols in one place
  properly DONE!  (also looks a lot nicer now, both in code and output)
- implement setjmp, longjmp DONE!
- implement str*cmp, str*cpy, strrchr, memcmp, memmove, mem*cpy DONE!
- fix cascaded branches (jump past, not before, the next conditional branch)
  DONE!

- implement (__builtin_)bzero() DONE!
- fix strchr (don't return NULL when looking for '\0') DONE!
- implement (__builtin_)ffs() DONE!
- implement abs() DONE!
- don't use arithmetic shift if only the shift count is signed DONE!
- do const long long -> float conversion at compile time DONE!
- truncate constant integer values before converting to another type DONE!
- do const to _Bool conversion at compile time DONE!
- zero structs before initializing them (decl_designator() tends to forget
  filling in holes when initializing nested structures) DONE! (probably
  more efficient anyway)
- don't forget to add offsets to symbols in binary output code DONE!
- make output code more robust against funky symbol tables (empty
  or duplicate symbols) DONE!
- fix hang in Arkanoid demo DONE! (Bozo read a write-only register)
- port SNESC library and kernel DONE!
- port Arkanoid demo DONE!
- fix sprite priority in SNESC kernel DONE!
- move libraries and startup code into separate directory DONE!
- split libtcc into libc (standard C functions) and libtcc (functions used
  internally by TCC) DONE!
- check why wla needs source file for linking -> it doesn't, just don't
  write a list file
- implement retargetable NMI handler DONE!
- make SNESC internal data symbolic DONE!
- fix local static declarations (name collision; done for get_sym_str(), but
  that's only half the solution; related test 990326-1.c) DONE!
- make binary default output format for 65816 DONE!
